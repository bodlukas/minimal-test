I am a doctoral student at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/), where I use probabilistic modelling and data analytics to advance risk assessment for spatially distributed systems exposed to natural hazards with a particular focus on earthquakes. During my studies I had the opportunity to conduct research at the [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). 

Before I started my doctoral studies, I worked at the Swiss Federal Railway as an asset manager for engineering structures with a particular focus on the bridge portfolio. 

This website is under development.
